# Philosophers 42 

## Learning Objectives : 
In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process.
You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes.

- I never thought philosophy would be so deadly - 

## Project Description :

Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat.

This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

### Overview : 

<ul>
<li>One or more philosophers sit at a round table. </li>
<li> There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.</li>
<li> The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.</li>
<li> While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;</li>
<li> of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.</li>
<li> There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.</li>
<li> Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.</li>
<li>When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation. </li>
<li> Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.</li>
<li> Philosophers don’t speak with each other.</li>
<li> Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.</li>
<li> No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!</li>
